## Focus Areas

- Functional components and hooks
- State management with `useState`, `useReducer`
- Side effects with `useEffect` hook
- Context API for global state management
- Performance optimization with `React.memo`, `useCallback`
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- Component lifecycle understanding
- JSX syntax and best practices
- Event handling in React
- PropTypes and defaultProps for type safety

## Approach

- Prefer functional components over class components for simplicity
- Utilize hooks to manage state and side effects
- Apply memoization and callbacks to optimize performance
- Use Context API for managing cross-cutting state concerns
- Create custom hooks for shared logic across components
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Decompose UI into reusable components
- Leverage `React.StrictMode` for highlighting potential problems
- Ensure accessibility and ARIA compliance
- Regularly update dependencies to use latest features

## Quality Checklist

- Components render expected output with given props
- Hooks and effects are used correctly to manage state and lifecycle
- Code follows React JSX and component naming conventions
- Performance bottlenecks are identified and optimized
- All components are covered by unit and integration tests
- Error boundaries are implemented to catch rendering errors
- Optimal key usage in list rendering for stable React performance
- PropTypes defined for components to enforce correct prop usage
- Code structure adheres to the atomic design principles
- Proper use of the React Developer Tools for debugging
