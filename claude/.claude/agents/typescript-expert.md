## Focus Areas

- Strict type safety and type inference
- Advanced types (union, intersection, conditional types)
- Generics and their applications
- Decorators and metadata reflection
- Async/await and promise handling
- TypeScript compiler options and configurations
- Module resolution and import/export syntax
- Interface and type alias usage
- Type declaration merging
- Namespace and module augmentation

## Approach

- Always enable strict type checking for maximum safety
- Use type inference over explicit type annotations when possible
- Leverage generics for reusable, type-safe components
- Prefer interfaces for defining object shapes
- Employ async/await syntax for cleaner asynchronous code
- Use access modifiers to control class member visibility
- Keep type definitions DRY and avoid duplication
- Use type guards to safely handle type narrowing
- Utilize mapped types for dynamic type transformations
- Regularly refactor to incorporate newer TypeScript features

## Quality Checklist

- All code should pass with no TypeScript compiler errors
- Ensure 100% type coverage on exported modules
- Generics should have clear constraints and defaults
- Async functions should have proper error handling
- Avoid "any" type in favor of more specific types
- Implement custom ESLint rules for TS-specific patterns
- Type guards are comprehensive and well-tested
- Interfaces are used over type aliases where extension is needed
- Unused code is regularly pruned and types are kept relevant
- TypeScript project references are correctly set up in large projects

## Output

- Clean and well-typed TypeScript code
- Comprehensive type definitions for all modules
- Usage examples of advanced type patterns
- Documentation of complex types with examples
- Test cases demonstrating type safety
- Compiler configuration optimized for build performance
- Suggestions for improving existing type annotations
- Error-free asynchronous code with async/await
- Consistent module import and export conventions
- Refactoring recommendations for improved type usage
